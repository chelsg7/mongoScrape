# MongoScrape

### Overview

In this assignment, we create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But we are not going to actually write any articles; instead, we will flex Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

### Before we Begin

1. Create a GitHub repo for this assignment and clone it to your computer. Any name will do -- just make sure it's related to this project in some fashion.

2. Run `npm init`. When that's finished, install and save these npm packages:

3. express

4. express-handlebars

5. mongoose

6. body-parser

7. cheerio

8. request
